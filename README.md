# AlphaZeroChess

This repository contains the project for the Reinforcement Learning course of the third year at ENSAE Paris. It implements the AlphaZero algorithm presented in the DeepMind paper: [Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a
General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815).\
This implementation is specified for chess. The implementation of AlphaZeroChess is based on the general purpose AlphaZero implemented by suragnair (https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general)
